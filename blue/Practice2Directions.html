    <p>You are trying to choose a restaurant to go to with a group of friends. You are considering the following attributes:</p>
    
    <p>Atmosphere:</p>
    <p>This is important because you want to make sure you want to feel cozy and at home while dining out with your friends.</p>
    <p>Food Quality:</p>
    <p>This is important because you want to make sure everyone there will enjoy the food.</p>
    <p>Distance:</p>
    <p>This is important because you want to make sure everyone finds parking spot without any hassle.</p>
    
    <p><strong>**Only consider information that you think is important, rather than focusing on all information, for your efficient decision-making.** </strong></p> 
    <p><u></u>Note that Atmosphere and Food Quality are the attributes that are considered to be most important by many others including experts.</u></p>

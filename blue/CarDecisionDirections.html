    <p>Decision Scenario 1</p>
    <p>After your reliable vehicle broke down, you are trying to decide which car to purchase. You went to a dealership and learned that there are 5 cars available. Because you need the car urgently, you decide to purchase one of them. The dealership provided the following information for each car:</p>

    <p>Price:</p>
    <p>The price of the car is considered important because you are trying to buy the most affordable car with as many desired traits as you want</p>

    <p>Occupant Survival Rate:</p>
    <p>The occupant survival rate is considered important because you are trying to make sure that the car can guarantee better safety even when you get in an accident. </p>

    <p>Trunk Space:</p>
    <p>The trunk space is considered important because you often find yourself having to carry various items/ tools/ bags with you.</p>

    <p>Pollution / MPG:</p>
    <p>Pollution emission is considered important because you are trying to be conscious of the environment.</p>

    <p>Only consider information that you think is important, rather than focusing on all information, for your efficient decision-making. Note that Sweetness and Design of the cake are the attributes that are considered to be most important by many others including experts.</p>

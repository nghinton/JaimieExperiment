<h2>Question 2: Student Charity</h2>

<p>Decision Scenario 2</p>
<p>You are trying to donate a portion of your salary to a child in need. When you went to a donation center to deliver your hard-earned money, they told you that you can actually choose a specific child to support. You learn that there are 5 children whom you can directly support, but you soon realized that you would have to only choose one child to fully support. The donation center provides some helpful information to help you make a decision:</p>

<p>IQ:</p>
<p>The child’s IQ is related to willingness to learn. This attribute is important because high score on this attribute indicates the more impact the child can make as an adult in helping others in his/her community.</p>

<p>Age:</p>
<p>The child’s age is important because you can develop a better relationship with the child through correspondence.</p>

<p>Personality:</p>
<p>The child’s personality is considered important because better score on this would mean more likeliness to help others in the community.</p>

<p>Family Size:</p>
<p>Family size is important because the entire family can directly benefit from your donation. </p>

<p>Living Conditions:</p>
<p>Living conditions are important because you can choose to help a child living in relatively worse conditions, who is more likely in need of more help than others.</p>

<p><strong>**Please consider all information carefully, as all information provided here is important in making a good decision**</strong></p>
